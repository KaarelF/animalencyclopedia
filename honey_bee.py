    introduction="A honey bee is a eusocial flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade, "
                 "all native to Afro-Eurasia. After bees spread naturally throughout Africa and Eurasia, "
                 "humans became responsible for the current cosmopolitan distribution of honey bees, "
                 "introducing multiple subspecies into South America (early 16th century), "
                 "North America (early 17th century), and Australia (early 19th century). "
                 "Honey bees are known for their construction of perennial colonial nests from wax, "
                 "the large size of their colonies, and surplus production and storage of honey, "
                 "distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many animals, "
                 "including honey badgers, bears and human hunter-gatherers. "
                 "Only eight surviving species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 43 subspecies, "
                 "though historically 7 to 11 species are recognized. Honey bees represent only a small "
