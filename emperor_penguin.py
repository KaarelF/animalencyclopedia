    introduction="The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest of all "
                 "living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica. The male and female are similar "
                 "in plumage and size, reaching 100 cm (39 in) in length and weighing from 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). "
                 "Feathers of the head and back are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, "
                 "pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches. Like all penguins, it is flightless, "
                 "with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. "
                 "Its diet consists primarily of fish, but also includes crustaceans, "
                 "such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. While hunting, "
                 "the species can remain submerged around 20 minutes, diving to a depth of 535 m (1,755 ft). "
                 "It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an unusually structured "
                 "haemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, "
                 "solid bones to reduce barotrauma, and the ability to reduce its metabolism and "
                 "shut down non-essential organ functions.",
