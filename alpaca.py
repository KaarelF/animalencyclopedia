    introduction="Alpacas are kept in herds that graze on the level heights of the Andes of Southern Peru, "
                 "Western Bolivia, Ecuador, and Northern Chile at an altitude of 3,500 to 5,000 metres "
                 "(11,000 to 16,000 feet) above sea level. Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, "
                 "and unlike llamas, they were not bred to be working animals, but were bred specifically "
                 "for their fiber. Alpaca fiber is used for making knitted and woven items, "
                 "similar to sheep's wool.Alpacas communicate through body language. "
                 "The most common is spitting to show dominance when they are in distress, fearful, "
                 "or feel agitated. Male alpacas are more aggressive than females, and tend to establish "
                 "dominance within their herd group. In some cases, alpha males will immobilize "
                 "the head and neck of a weaker or challenging male in order to show their "
                 "strength and dominance.An adult alpaca generally is between 81 and 99 centimetres "
                 "(32 and 39 inches) in height at the shoulders (withers). They usually weigh between "
                 "48 and 90 kilograms (106 and 198 pounds).[4] Raised in the same conditions, "
                 "the difference in weight can be small with males weighting around 22.3 kilograms (49 lb 3 oz) "
                 "and females 21.3 kilograms (46 lb 15 oz)",
